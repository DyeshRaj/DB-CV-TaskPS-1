PS1: Colour Based Object Tracking 
Create a program that can detect and track an object of specific colour in real time. The 
program must be able to process video frames and identify regions matching the same colour 
and track those regions in real-time.  
Dataset: 
No pre-labelled dataset is required, however the input video stream (webcam) must be 
converted to HSV before detection. 
Expected Outcomes: 
• The system should work smoothly on the real time input, detecting the colour with 
minimum lag.  
• The detected region/object must be highlighted using a bounding box 
• The output should display a live video feed with clear visual indicators marking the 
detected object.
